Attempt at general purpose translation between materials project (API) and Quantum Espresso (pw.x) input files.

Requires:
Numpy
SciPy
Atomic Simulation Environment
PSLibrary Pseudopotential Library

Setup:
This early version requires just three input parameters:
  (i) Materials project api key (api_key set in quick_mpapi.py)
 (ii) Materials project material id code (for best results use scf task id) (material_id set in quick_mpapi.py)
(iii) Path to pseudopotential library (set in pseudopotentials.py)

NB this set of inputs will be edited/expanded in the future.

All the best,
Josh
